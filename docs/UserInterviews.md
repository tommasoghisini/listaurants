## Interview 1

```
[00:00.000 --> 00:10.240]  Okay, so this is the first interview.
[00:10.240 --> 00:15.280]  So could you please tell us your age, your gender, your occupation, and for how long
[00:15.280 --> 00:16.480]  you've been living in Copenhagen?
[00:16.480 --> 00:20.840]  Of course, I am 22, almost 23 years old.
[00:20.840 --> 00:22.840]  I am a female.
[00:22.840 --> 00:26.600]  I am a student, but also work part time.
[00:26.600 --> 00:30.560]  And I've been living in Copenhagen for a little bit over a year now.
[00:30.560 --> 00:32.560]  Okay, cool.
[00:32.560 --> 00:38.560]  Then second question is, how many times per month do you go out to eat at a restaurant?
[00:38.560 --> 00:42.440]  I would say once or twice, probably.
[00:42.440 --> 00:43.440]  Per month?
[00:43.440 --> 00:44.440]  Yeah.
[00:44.440 --> 00:45.440]  Okay.
[00:45.440 --> 00:46.440]  Cool.
[00:46.440 --> 00:47.440]  All right.
[00:47.440 --> 00:49.560]  Is Reven like a restaurant as well?
[00:49.560 --> 00:50.560]  Yes.
[00:50.560 --> 00:51.560]  Yeah.
[00:51.560 --> 00:52.560]  I mean, restaurants, we mean like going out.
[00:52.560 --> 00:53.560]  Yeah, going out to eat.
[00:53.560 --> 00:56.720]  Yeah, going out to eat with your friends or even going to a market and like sitting down
[00:56.720 --> 00:57.720]  and having food.
[00:57.720 --> 00:59.720]  I mean, considering this week I've already done it twice.
[00:59.720 --> 01:00.720]  Yeah.
[01:00.720 --> 01:01.720]  Yeah, maybe more, maybe four times.
[01:01.720 --> 01:02.720]  Okay, then.
[01:02.720 --> 01:03.720]  Yeah, let's say four.
[01:03.720 --> 01:04.720]  Okay.
[01:04.720 --> 01:07.000]  Would you say like it depends from season to season as well?
[01:07.000 --> 01:08.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.600]  Probably in the summer I did more than probably in the winter.
[01:12.600 --> 01:18.040]  So how frequently do you try a new restaurant?
[01:18.040 --> 01:23.440]  Pretty often like maybe out of those four, maybe like two would be a new.
[01:23.440 --> 01:24.440]  Or one.
[01:24.440 --> 01:25.440]  Okay.
[01:25.440 --> 01:28.560]  Okay, cool.
[01:28.560 --> 01:31.960]  What do you base your choice of restaurant on?
[01:31.960 --> 01:39.240]  The cuisine of the restaurant, whether they have vegetarian options and whether I've heard
[01:39.240 --> 01:42.200]  about it like through someone or through somewhere.
[01:42.200 --> 01:43.200]  Cool.
[01:43.200 --> 01:47.000]  Do you find it difficult choosing where to go?
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.520]  Yes, sometimes.
[01:49.520 --> 01:50.520]  Okay.
[01:50.520 --> 01:52.280]  Why would you say it's difficult?
[01:52.280 --> 01:53.280]  Why?
[01:53.280 --> 01:59.400]  Because there's a lot of options and if I don't have a reference, it's hard to decide.
[01:59.400 --> 02:02.880]  I guess if someone already has an idea of where to go, then it's easier.
[02:02.880 --> 02:07.400]  But if I have to decide myself, there's too many options.
[02:07.400 --> 02:09.600]  Cool.
[02:09.600 --> 02:14.800]  Do you have a list of your favorite places, your favorite restaurants?
[02:14.800 --> 02:17.600]  I would say I'm building it.
[02:17.600 --> 02:21.760]  So when I go to a new place, I've been saving those places that I like.
[02:21.760 --> 02:23.040]  So it's a small list.
[02:23.040 --> 02:24.040]  Okay, cool.
[02:24.040 --> 02:28.040]  And how do you keep track of the restaurants?
[02:28.040 --> 02:29.560]  Which format is your list?
[02:29.560 --> 02:31.200]  Is it like a mental list?
[02:31.200 --> 02:36.040]  No, I use Google Maps saved thingies.
[02:36.040 --> 02:39.800]  Okay, cool.
[02:39.800 --> 02:44.480]  How often do you share your dining experience or restaurant recommendations?
[02:44.480 --> 02:49.440]  Pretty often, whenever like anyone asks me for a recommendation, I will just share the
[02:49.440 --> 02:55.400]  list or recently when I've met new people from school, yeah, I've given recommendations.
[02:55.400 --> 02:59.160]  Okay, so is this something you do?
[02:59.160 --> 03:06.000]  If we had to quantify it, how often would you say we or like you do it?
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.600]  I don't know.
[03:08.600 --> 03:12.480]  Especially if it's special, if there's someone visiting, I guess, otherwise, not that often.
[03:12.480 --> 03:15.000]  Okay, so then it's not like something that every month?
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  No, it's not periodically.
[03:17.000 --> 03:18.000]  Okay, cool.
[03:18.560 --> 03:26.160]  So how often do you ask for restaurant recommendations from your peers, family, friends?
[03:26.160 --> 03:33.200]  Also pretty often whenever I want to go out to eat, and I don't know of a place, I will
[03:33.200 --> 03:37.080]  just ask a friend who I know has like more experience in me.
[03:37.080 --> 03:39.920]  Okay, but again, it's hard to quantify it, I guess.
[03:39.920 --> 03:40.920]  Yeah, I would say so.
[03:40.920 --> 03:42.540]  Okay, makes sense.
[03:42.540 --> 03:46.720]  In what situation would you look for restaurants recommendation on the internet?
[03:46.720 --> 03:51.800]  And in what situation would you look for recommendation through asking your peers?
[03:51.800 --> 03:55.000]  Oh God, no worries.
[03:55.000 --> 04:02.040]  On the internet and to peers, that's hard to say.
[04:02.040 --> 04:07.500]  I feel like when I'm going out with someone and neither of us have any idea, then I'll
[04:07.500 --> 04:09.680]  just search in the internet.
[04:09.680 --> 04:14.360]  But if that person already has like, or if my roommates, I know they've been out recently
[04:14.360 --> 04:17.520]  to some place, I will just ask them.
[04:17.520 --> 04:18.520]  Okay.
[04:18.520 --> 04:22.120]  And do you just like go on the internet or do you have some website?
[04:22.120 --> 04:23.120]  Do you?
[04:23.120 --> 04:24.120]  Google maps.
[04:24.120 --> 04:25.120]  Okay.
[04:25.120 --> 04:26.120]  Use filters.
[04:26.120 --> 04:27.120]  Okay.
[04:27.120 --> 04:28.120]  Cool.
[04:28.120 --> 04:32.400]  And then can you describe a situation where you tried out a new restaurant?
[04:32.400 --> 04:33.400]  How do you find out?
[04:33.400 --> 04:36.520]  So for example, example, how you found it?
[04:36.520 --> 04:37.520]  Last night.
[04:37.520 --> 04:39.520]  How was your experience?
[04:39.520 --> 04:45.880]  Last night I went to a new restaurant and I think my friend decided like she just proposed
[04:45.880 --> 04:48.240]  it and she hadn't tried it either.
[04:48.240 --> 04:53.040]  So I think she just like saw it on Google maps or like, uh, because it's in the meat
[04:53.040 --> 04:54.040]  packing.
[04:54.040 --> 04:57.200]  So like some more times we've walked past and like seen it.
[04:57.200 --> 04:58.200]  Cool.
[04:58.200 --> 04:59.200]  So, okay.
[04:59.200 --> 05:00.200]  I think that's it.
[05:00.200 --> 05:01.200]  Thank you.
[05:01.200 --> 05:01.220]  Amazing.
```

## Interview 2
```
[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  Okay, so we can start with our interview. What's your age, gender, occupation, and how long have you been living in Copenhagen?
[00:14.000 --> 00:26.000]  My age is 30, age is male, occupation is student, and I have been living for three weeks.
[00:26.000 --> 00:36.000]  How many times per month do you go out to eat at a restaurant?
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  A month like one to two times max.
[00:42.000 --> 00:43.000]  Per month?
[00:43.000 --> 00:45.000]  Per month, yeah.
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  How frequently do you try a new restaurant?
[00:52.000 --> 00:59.000]  Not so frequently, maybe a month.
[00:59.000 --> 01:00.000]  Per month?
[01:00.000 --> 01:07.000]  Per month, like zero, like two, three times per year maybe.
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  Sometimes I try something new, sometimes not.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  Just per month, like zero.
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  And if you try a new restaurant, what do you base your choice of restaurant on?
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  Like when you go out to eat, what is your criteria for choosing your restaurant?
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  Okay, there are two points. The first one is like menu, because I'm vegetarian.
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  And the second point is like the reviews or how good the restaurant is.
[01:37.000 --> 01:48.000]  Okay. Do you find it difficult to choose where you go?
[01:48.000 --> 01:58.000]  Sometimes, because I'm vegetarian, it's not so easy to find a restaurant for vegetarians.
[01:58.000 --> 02:05.000]  Or a restaurant where I can have some vegetarian, but it's not only vegetarian, that's the point.
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.000]  But it's not so hard, like I always Google it and then I find something.
[02:11.000 --> 02:19.000]  Okay. Do you have a list of favorite restaurants?
[02:19.000 --> 02:27.000]  I have, yeah. I save all the restaurants there are good or where.
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  And in which format do you have the restaurants, like the list of restaurants?
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  I save on Google Maps.
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.000]  On Google Maps?
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.000]  Yeah, I have a list for like restaurants.
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  Okay. Also in Munich?
[02:41.000 --> 02:42.000]  Yeah.
[02:42.000 --> 02:49.000]  Okay.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  And do you also have a list of restaurants you would like to visit?
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  So it doesn't have to be your favorite restaurants, but you want to visit sometimes.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  I have it, like sometimes suggestions from friends or something like that.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  So I have a list like restaurants to visit.
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  And that's also on Google Maps?
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  It's also on Google Maps, yeah.
[03:13.000 --> 03:22.000]  Okay. And how often do you share your dining experiences or restaurant recommendations?
[03:22.000 --> 03:29.000]  Like have you ever shared any recommendations or experiences?
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  Just like talking to friends, but not sharing my list.
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  But just talking to friends and saying, okay, this restaurant is good or not good.
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  Do you have some suggestions, but not sharing my list.
[03:43.000 --> 03:53.000]  And do you do that frequently with friends or no, not that often?
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  Not that often.
[03:56.000 --> 04:04.000]  And how often do you ask for restaurant recommendations from your peers?
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.000]  Not that often.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  Not that often.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  No.
[04:08.000 --> 04:20.000]  Sometimes when I'm searching for something new, like then I ask some friends, but not that often.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  Okay.
[04:23.000 --> 04:36.000]  And what would be like a case or a situation where you seek for recommendations from your friends?
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  A situation where I seek for recommendations.
[04:39.000 --> 04:47.000]  Maybe sometimes when I'm not sure if a restaurant is good, like I can ask some friends, were you there?
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  Do you know this restaurant? Can you tell me something about that?
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.000]  Yeah.
[04:51.000 --> 05:04.000]  Then I ask some friends, but also not so often.
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  In what situations would you look for restaurant recommendations on the internet?
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  And in what situations would you seek for recommendations through asking your peers?
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  Is there a difference?
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  I always search for a restaurant on the internet.
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.000]  Yeah.
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  And after that, I ask some friends.
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  But the first thing is always googling.
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.000]  First step is googling?
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  Yeah.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  And after that, I can ask someone.
[05:33.000 --> 05:47.000]  Okay.
[05:47.000 --> 05:55.000]  And then now please try to describe a situation when you tried out a new restaurant.
[05:55.000 --> 06:05.000]  If you have something in your mind where you tried a new restaurant and how was the situation back then?
[06:05.000 --> 06:11.000]  How did you find it or what kind of restaurant was it and some kind of things?
[06:11.000 --> 06:15.000]  If anything comes into your mind.
[06:15.000 --> 06:24.000]  Describe a situation where you tried out a new restaurant.
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.000]  When I try out a new restaurant.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  You mean after that, what is the situation?
[06:32.000 --> 06:42.000]  How you found the new restaurant maybe?
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  Maybe in Copenhagen?
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.000]  Yeah.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  Have you tried a new restaurant in Copenhagen?
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  Not yet.
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  Have you tried a new restaurant in Munich?
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.000]  Yeah.
[06:54.000 --> 06:55.000]  Before?
[06:55.000 --> 06:56.000]  Yeah.
[06:56.000 --> 06:57.000]  Yes?
[06:57.000 --> 06:58.000]  Yes.
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.000]  And how did you find it?
[07:01.000 --> 07:02.000]  Googling.
[07:02.000 --> 07:03.000]  Googling?
[07:03.000 --> 07:04.000]  Yeah.
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.000]  Okay.
[07:05.000 --> 07:06.000]  Most of the time.
[07:06.000 --> 07:07.000]  Most of the time?
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.000]  Most of the time.
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.000]  Just googling.
[07:09.000 --> 07:10.000]  Just googling.
[07:10.000 --> 07:11.000]  Yeah.
[07:11.000 --> 07:12.000]  Okay.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  Sometimes it's like advertising.
[07:16.000 --> 07:22.000]  I see some advertisements and then like, oh, there's a new restaurant, maybe I can try
[07:22.000 --> 07:23.000]  it.
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  But most of the time it's just googling.
[07:26.000 --> 07:27.000]  Yeah.
[07:28.000 --> 07:29.000]  Yeah.
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  I think like we're done with the questions.
[07:33.000 --> 07:50.000]  But is the, does the event play a role for your restaurant choice?
[07:50.000 --> 08:01.000]  Like for example, if you're going out by yourself and if you go out with somebody like on a
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  date, then does it make any difference in choosing where to go?
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.000]  Yes.
[08:07.000 --> 08:08.000]  Yes.
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.000]  Okay.
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.000]  Yes.
[08:10.000 --> 08:11.000]  Of course.
[08:11.000 --> 08:12.000]  Yes.
[08:12.000 --> 08:13.000]  Okay.
[08:13.000 --> 08:14.000]  Okay.
[08:14.000 --> 08:15.000]  And what's the difference?
[08:16.000 --> 08:26.000]  Most of the time, like how quiet it is or the menu, how expensive is also a point.
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.000]  Yeah.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  That's it.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  How quiet and the menu.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  The menu and how expensive.
[08:34.000 --> 08:35.000]  How expensive.
[08:35.000 --> 08:36.000]  The price.
[08:36.000 --> 08:37.000]  Yeah.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  The price is important.
[08:39.000 --> 08:40.000]  Okay.
[08:40.000 --> 08:41.000]  Okay.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  I think we're done with the interview.
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  Thank you for your time and yes.
```
## Interview 3
```
[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  All right, then we have a little interview here. I'm gonna get the questions.
[00:10.000 --> 00:19.000]  So, can you first start by telling your name, gender, occupation, and how long you have been living in Copenhagen?
[00:19.000 --> 00:31.000]  So, my name is Sara Kautto, I'm a female, I'm a student, and also I work part-time as a data analyst.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  And I've lived in Copenhagen for one year.
[00:36.000 --> 00:43.000]  Nice. How many times per month would you say you go out to eat in a restaurant?
[00:43.000 --> 00:51.000]  And that could be anything from a fine dining place to getting a pizza slice at the pizzeria.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  In a month.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  Approximately.
[00:56.000 --> 01:06.000]  Let's say maybe like two times a week, so that would be eight times a month or something, approximately.
[01:06.000 --> 01:12.000]  And how frequently do you try a new place?
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  Very rarely, because most times I usually get like a falafel or something.
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.000]  Then it's always the same as places, but then if I would go to like a fine dining place, then I would always try something new.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  Okay.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  Or not fine dining, fancy restaurant.
[01:29.000 --> 01:36.000]  And when you make a choice for what restaurant to go to, what do you base that decision on?
[01:37.000 --> 01:46.000]  Well, the menu. I mean, I'm a vegetarian, so I always check that they have vegetarian options.
[01:46.000 --> 01:53.000]  Also, just how the portions look in the menu and town.
[01:53.000 --> 02:02.000]  Also, I usually would look something maybe on social media, some pictures, how the atmosphere is in the restaurant, maybe see some reviews.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  But I mean, usually they're based on recommendations from people I know.
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  All right.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.000]  And then now I'm resuming.
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  Do you find it difficult choosing where to go?
[02:32.000 --> 02:42.000]  Yes, sometimes. I think especially when I want to go to like a nicer restaurant, like a maybe fancier restaurant and pay a little bit more.
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.000]  There are so many options for like dinner places.
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  And there are in Copenhagen a lot of places with good reviews and blah, blah, blah.
[02:51.000 --> 03:01.000]  So then sometimes it is quite difficult to choose and also like find out the best ones.
[03:10.000 --> 03:17.000]  Do you have a list of favorite restaurants? And if you do, then in what format do you have that list?
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  I don't really have a list. It's only in my head.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  OK, fair enough.
[03:24.000 --> 03:34.000]  What I do have, like I use Google Maps and in Google Maps, I always mark the restaurants that I want to go to or I've been to and I like them.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  OK, so it's both the ones that you want to go to and ones that you've been to.
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  OK, that's interesting. And you have both in Google Maps.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  And how often do you share dining experiences or restaurant recommendations?
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.000]  With friends all the time, I think, especially when like people have maybe their friends or families visiting Copenhagen.
[04:00.000 --> 04:07.000]  We always like kind of discuss it with each other and are like, oh, what would be a nice restaurant to go to?
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  But I mean, it's not so common because we are all students and it's so expensive.
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  So maybe it's not like a daily topic of conversation because no one can afford it.
[04:22.000 --> 04:29.000]  I'm sorry about the delay. My phone being annoying.
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  How often do you ask for restaurant recommendations from your peers?
[04:37.000 --> 04:47.000]  I think in the beginning, very often, maybe then I got like lists of restaurants and then I could use those recommendations for multiple times.
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  But I think now at this point, I feel like most of the good places are already in my head.
[04:53.000 --> 05:05.000]  So then I don't necessarily need to ask again. But let's say then it would be like a once in a four, five months kind of question.
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.000]  In what situation would you look through for restaurant recommendations on the Internet?
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  And in what situations would you look for recommendations through asking your peers?
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  Is this only in Copenhagen?
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  It doesn't have to be in Copenhagen. It can be other places too.
[05:29.000 --> 05:38.000]  But for me, because when I'm traveling, I usually look them up online, even though I would know that maybe my friends have been in the city.
[05:38.000 --> 05:47.000]  I don't know. It just feels also nice to do the research like in advance and look up all the nice places in a new city.
[05:47.000 --> 05:56.000]  But then when it's a place where I know someone really lives and has really actually experience in it and not just like a two week holiday or something,
[05:56.000 --> 06:06.000]  then I usually when I can count on them for really trying or having tried different things, then I would ask for the friends.
[06:06.000 --> 06:12.000]  And when you look things up on the Internet, what device would you use for doing that?
[06:13.000 --> 06:17.000]  Such as like on the computer or on the phone or...
[06:17.000 --> 06:22.000]  Oh, but device. OK, OK. I think on the phone mostly. Yes.
[06:22.000 --> 06:28.000]  Maybe sometimes also on the computer, but I think mostly on my phone. Yes. Some vlogs.
[06:28.000 --> 06:48.000]  And finally, describe a situation where you tried out a new restaurant. It could be in the last year in Copenhagen. How did you find it?
[06:49.000 --> 07:00.000]  Actually, they were all probably recommended by friends. Yeah, I think most of them. Yes.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  And how did you ask your friends for it?
[07:04.000 --> 07:10.000]  I asked, yeah, like either in person or then by text messages.
[07:10.000 --> 07:19.000]  And then a lot of people have these lists maybe in their phone notes and then they can share those lists easily just by copy pasting.
[07:19.000 --> 07:26.000]  So that usually has been the source. All right. Thank you so much.
[07:26.000 --> 07:28.000]  That was it. No worries.

Q. How frequently do you try a new restaurant? 
A: “Whenever I get a good hint from a ‘good eater’ - someone who I know likes the same

Q. What do you base your choice of restaurant on?
A: “Many things. Recommendations, price, location, availability.”

Q. Do you find it difficult choosing where to go? 
A: “Yes. Mainly because of lack of time and budget. I hardly ever have time to go out and whenever I have time, I don’t have the money to spend on expensive dinners.”

Q. Do you have a list of favorite restaurants? If so, in what format?
A: “Yes I do. With the greatest criteria to be value for money. In what format? In my mind or
     saved on Google maps.”

Q. Do you have a list of restaurants you would like to visit? If so, in what format?
A: “Yeah. A list online for the top10 Michelin restaurant guide that I found by Googling, or       
     other websites listing top restaurants in town. So, it’s not a list I’ve created myself just                           found online.”

Q. How often do you share your dining experiences or restaurant recommendations?
A: “I would say quite often. With friends and family, I definitely share whenever I’m asked or   if the visit has been very good that I feel like I need others to go try it, or when it has been very, very bad I warn people. I rarely share anywhere else, like on social media or other platforms. “

Q. How often do you ask for restaurant recommendations from your peers?
A: ”Quite often as well. I’m always open for nice recommendations.”

Q. In what situations would you look for restaurant recommendations on the internet and in what situations would you look for recommendations through asking your peers?
A: “I would choose the internet if I was in a place, city that I have never visited before. In Copenhagen I would ask my friends first and then check online myself.”
